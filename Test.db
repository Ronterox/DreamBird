===== Exclamation.db =====

// Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!
print("hi there!")!

// If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!
print("hi there mooom!")!!!

// You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead.
// It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.
print("hi mom?")?

// That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead
if (;false) {
	print("hi mom!")!
}

===== Declarations.db =====

// Constant constants can't be changed in any way.
const const name = "LUKE"!

// Constant variables can be edited, but not re-assigned.
const var name = "LUUKE"!
name.pop()!
name.pop()!

// Variable constants can be re-assigned, but not edited.
var const name = "LUUKE"!
name = "Lu"!

// Variable variables can be re-assigned and edited.
var var name = "LUUKE"!
name = "Lu"!
name.push("k")!
name.push("e")!

===== Immutable.db =====

// Its value will become constant and immutable, and will never change.
// Please be careful with this keyword, as it is very powerful, and will affect all users globally forever.
const const const pi = 3.14159!
print(pi)!

===== Naming.db =====

// Both variables and constants can be named with any Unicode character or string.
// const const letter = 'A'!
// var const 👍 = true!
// var var 1️⃣ = 1!

// This includes numbers, and other language constructs.
// const const 5 = 4!
print(2 + 2 === 5)! //true

===== Arrays.db =====

// Best of both worlds: Arrays start at -1

const const scores = [3, 2, 5]!
print(scores[-1])! //3
print(scores[0])!  //2
print(scores[1])!  //5

// You can now use floats for indexes too!
const var scores = [3, 2, 5]!
scores[0.5] = 4!
print(scores)! //[3, 2, 4, 5]

===== When.db =====

===== Lifetimes.db =====

===== Loops.db =====

// Loops are a complicated relic of archaic programming languages. There are no loops.

===== Installation.db =====

===== Booleans.db =====

// Booleans can be true, false or maybe.

const var keys = {}!
addEventListener("keydown", (e) => keys[e.key] = true)!
addEventListener("keyup", (e) => keys[e.key] = false)!

function isKeyDown(key) => {
   if (keys[key] = undefined) {
      return maybe!
   }
   return keys[key]!
}

===== Arithmetic.db =====

// Has significant whitespace. Use spacing to specify the order of arithmetic operations.

print(1 + 2*3)! //7
print(1+2 * 3)! //9

// Proudly supports fractions!

const const half = 1/2!

// You can also use number names.

print(one + two)! //3

===== Indents.db =====

// When it comes to indentation, indents should be 3 spaces long.
function plus3() => {
   print("hell yea! it works!")!
}

// -3 spaces is also allowed.
   function minus3() => {
print("hell yea! it works!")!
   }

===== Equality.db =====

// You can use == to do a loose check.
print(3.14 == "3.14")! //true

// You can use === to do a more precise check.
print(3.14 === "3.14")! //false

// You can use ==== to be EVEN MORE precise!
const const pi = 3.14!
print(pi ==== pi)! //true
print(3.14 ==== 3.14)! //true
print(3.14 ==== pi)! //false

===== Functions.db =====

===== Division.db =====

// Dividing by zero returns undefined.
print(3 / 0)! //undefined

===== Strings.db =====

===== Interpotion.db =====

===== Types.db =====

===== TimeTravel.db =====

===== Exporting.db =====

===== Classes.db =====

===== Time.db =====

===== Delete.db =====

===== Overloading.db =====

// You can overload variables. The most recently defined variable gets used.

const const name = "Luke"!
const const name = "Lu"!
print(name)! // "Lu"

// Variables with more exclamation marks get prioritized.
const const name = "Lu"!!
const const name = "Luke"!
print(name)! // "Lu"

const const name = "Lu or Luke (either is fine)"!!!!!!!!!
print(name)! // "Lu or Luke (either is fine)"

// In the same spirit, you can use an inverted exclamation mark for negative priority.
const const name = "Lu"!
// const const name = "Luke"¡
print(name)! // "Lu"
